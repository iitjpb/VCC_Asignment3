Document Report : Auto Scale Local VM to GCP 

Objective : To set up a local VM with resource monitoring and enable auto-scaling to Google Cloud when system resources exceed a defined threshold (e.g., 75%). A sample application will be deployed to demonstrate the complete flow.


Step 1 : Creation of Local VM on Virtual Box

â€¢  Download Ubuntu ISO 
â€¢  Open VirtualBox / VMware â†’ Click "New".
â€¢	Name: UbuntuVM1
â€¢	Type: Linux â†’ Ubuntu (64-bit)
â€¢	Memory: 4GB (recommended)
â€¢	Disk: 20GB dynamically allocated
â€¢  Attach ISO and complete OS installation.

 

Step 2. Implementation of Resource Monitoring- Prometheus & Node Exporter
â€¢	Download Prometheus using GUI & then configure Node exporter in the same way.
â€¢	Visit the official Prometheus GitHub release page:
ðŸ‘‰ https://prometheus.io/download/
â€¢	Click on the Linux AMD64 tarball, Choose the latest version and download the file:

â€¢	Open Files and navigate to your Downloads folder.
â€¢	Right-click the downloaded .tar.gz file â†’ Extract Here.
â€¢	Open the extracted folder. Youâ€™ll see the prometheus binary file
â€¢	Right-click the prometheus file â†’ Properties.
â€¢	Go to the Permissions tab.
â€¢	Check "Allow executing file as program".
â€¢	 
 
Step 3. Configuration of Cloud Auto-Scaling Policies and Resource Migration.
Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Steps:
A. Install GCP CLI
B. Create Service Account & Download Key
1.	Go to IAM > Service Accounts.
2.	Create account with Compute Admin role.
3.	Generate JSON key file and save to VM.
 
 

C. Install Python Libraries
D. Python Script for Auto-Scaling
Create monitor_scale.py:
 
4.	Deployment of Sample Application

â€¢	SSH into the GCP VM:
â€¢	Install Flask:
â€¢	Create app.py:
â€¢	Run the app:
